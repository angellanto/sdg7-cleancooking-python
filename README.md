### Computational Data Analytics with Python | Individual Assignment: 94/100
### Professor Comment: 
Thank you for the submission.

Your report presents an interesting case study on clean fuels, linking traditional fuel reliance, clean cooking access, and ESG objectives with a compelling introduction and image.

Additionally, you provided a detailed description of the data cleaning process, along with well-referenced report with page numbers for easy navigation, good data visualizations and application of ARIMA forecasting, SARIMAX, and K-Means clustering across different countries.
However, there are areas for improvement, including:
1. Missing in-text citations of all references, including data sources and models
2. An in-depth discussion on the impact of clean fuels on ESG objectives, especially on the social, environmental, and economic implications.
3. Justification for model selection why ARIMA and SARIMAX were chosen over alternative forecasting techniques.

Enhancing these area will further strengthen your analysis and alignment with ESG objectives, showcasing a profound understanding of the assignment and complete command of tools from the course.

You had an excellent understanding of your code in the viva and excellent 'good programming' practices used in the implementation of the code,


Well Done!!!
### Assignment Instructions:
Description of Assignment:

In this project, you will address an Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issue by applying the data analysis and modeling techniques covered in Sessions 1-7. Your task is to analyze an ESG-related problem, apply suitable modeling techniques, and interpret your findings in the context of ESG goals, while also considering ethical issues.

Project Components:

Data Analysis and Modeling:

Apply data analysis techniques such as logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), or time series forecasting to address your chosen ESG issue.
Perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations and modeling to extract insights from your dataset.
Interpretation of Results in the Context of ESG:

Relate your findings to an ESG goal (e.g., analyzing renewable energy trends, predicting social impact metrics, etc.).
Discuss how your analysis supports or contributes to the achievement of specific ESG objectives.
Ethical Considerations Related to ESG:

Address ethical issues related to fairness, inclusivity, and bias in your data and models.
Reflect on:
Whether your data is representative of diverse groups.
Is your data reflective of a real world data set.
Ways to improve realistic conclusion in your analysis and predictions.
Submission Requirements:

Jupyter Notebook (PDF):

Submit your Jupyter Notebook as a PDF format. The notebook should include:
Code for data cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
Outputs such as graphs, tables, and model results.
Documentation and comments explaining your code and methodology.
Written Explanation (PDF):

Submit a separate document explaining how your project addresses ESG goals. This document should:
Provide an overview of the ESG issue you are analyzing.
Discuss how your chosen techniques align with ESG objectives.
Explain how you incorporated ethical considerations into your analysis, particularly around fairness and inclusivity.
Reflect on the social and environmental impact of your findings.
You must also present your analysis in a presentation that should not be more than 10 minutes long.

> How to submit the assignment:

In order to submit this assignment, record a video as a team and upload it to YouTube.
Ensure your video has been uploaded as an unlisted video and the link is NOT set to PRIVATE.
Upload your slides from the presentation as well. Make sure that your Youtube video link has been added in your slides or submit the link directly into the submission box (do NOT upload the video on myCourses).
Please note that you don't have to wait for the video to upload to YouTube before you can use the link. The link is live as soon as it is created on YouTube. You will still need to ensure the video is uploaded to YouTube successfully.
